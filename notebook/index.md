# DATAROOM

## Overview

Dataroom is a modern notes app that turns your browser into a powertool.

Every dataroom page is editable, including this one. To interact with the page use the right column.

To modify the code underpinnings you will need an external browser. LNSY likes #sublime-text, but you do you.

For more information, click the following hashtag on the right panel: #help

## Setup

To properly utilize dataroom templates you need to set some variables. 

With your text editor of choice create a file named *.keys* at the root of the Dataroom folder.

Keys you may add: 

For #geo-map the format looks like:

```
GEO_MAP_ACCESS_TOKEN= ${insert keys here}
GEO_MAP_STYLE_URL= ${insert keys here}


```
